Hi, I'm Benjamin Darnell. I am a student studying Computer Science in the [College of Creative Studies](https://ccs.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Outside of school, I enjoy making maps, unicycling, and playing bridge. I am on the organizing team of [SB Hacks](https://sbhacks.com) and I also am the current president of the [UCSB Juggling Club](https://juggling.bdarnell.com)
